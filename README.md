Update: Version 2 now released
Added fixed positioning to the table of contents and thus removing the need to scroll all the way up to go to a certain heading. Enhanced readability by: changing font, increased heading sizes, added paragraph indentation, increased line height, increased link color contrast, increased padding in pictures and increased paragraph margins. Implemented a more efficiently placed modern looking search bar along with increased readability in search results.
