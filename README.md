Features
=====================

Added fixed positioning to the table of contents and thus removing the need to scroll all the way up to go to a certain heading. Enhanced readability by: changing font, increased heading sizes, added paragraph indentation, increased line height, increased link color contrast, increased padding in pictures and increased paragraph margins. Implemented a more efficiently placed modern looking search bar along with increased readability in search results.

Changes to the extension can be made through the style.css file which changes the design of wikipedia or the manifest.json file to load other custom files.
